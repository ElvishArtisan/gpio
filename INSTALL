To install the driver, proceed as follows:

1)  Make sure that the sources for the version of the Linux kernel
    currently running are properly installed.  In particular, the 
    '/lib/modules/<kernel-version>/build' symlink needs to exist and
    point to the correct location (the root of the current kernel
    source tree).


2)  Cd to the top of the gpio source tree, and then do:

       ./configure
       make

followed by (as root):

       make install


3)  Start the driver to test things out.  If all of your GPIO devices
    are PCI based, then this is simply a matter of doing (as root):

       /etc/init.d/gpio start

    If you are using an ISA based card (e.g. CIO-DIO24), then you will
    need to edit the 'PACKAGE_OPTIONS' line in the init script to set
    the card type and I/O address to the module (see item 4 for details).

    The currently supported board types are:

       CIO-DIO24  0x0028

    Next do:

	 ls /proc/driver/gpio

    You should see one or more file entries, of the form 'card0,
    card1, ...'.  Examine the contents of each, by doing:

	 cat /proc/driver/gpio/card0

    You should see something like:

             Board: MeasurementComputing PCI-PDISO8
              Mode: AUTO
       Input Lines: 8
      Output Lines: 8
      Analog Lines: 0
  Analog Bit Depth: 0

   Inputs:
    00:Off  01:Off  02:Off  03:Off  04:Off  05:Off  06:Off  07:Off  

  Outputs:
    00:Off  01:Off  02:Off  03:Off  04:Off  05:Off  06:Off  07:Off  

  Filters:
    00:Off  01:Off  02:Off  03:Off  04:Off  05:Off  06:Off  07:Off  


4)  Enable the driver.  On SuSE, simply run Yast2, select 'Runlevel 
    Editor' and enable the GPIO service.  If you are
    using an ISA based card, you will need to edit the script
    '/etc/init.d/gpio' and add the module startup options to the
    'PACKAGE_OPTIONS=' line in the section entitled 'Package
    Definitions'.

The programming interface is documented in the file 'API'.
